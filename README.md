A project for salons who want to offer their clients loyalty cards digitally.

Will offer easy maintenace through a dashboard that will provide useful stats to the salon owner - such as lifetime visits, number of clients with full cards (enabling better financial planning), and much more.

** Next job is to add the backend view for the salon owner, showing a list of users and their current status with stamps. Plus, a summary of how many users have full cards, and how many are approaching full (for better planning in advance)

Future updates will add even more features - such as contacting via email/SMS for easy commiunication with loyalty card clients.

A WORK IN PROGRESS AND IN EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT
